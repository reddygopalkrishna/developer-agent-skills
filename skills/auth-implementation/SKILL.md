# Auth Implementation

Auth bugs are quiet: the feature works for every honest user and fails only for the attacker. Use a vetted identity provider or library, pick the flow from the table below, validate every token fully, and check authorization on the server for every request and every object.

## When to use

- Adding sign-in, SSO, social login, or integrating an identity provider (IdP).
- Issuing, storing, validating or refreshing JWTs, access tokens or refresh tokens.
- Choosing between cookie sessions and tokens, especially for single-page apps.
- Adding roles, permissions, tenant isolation, or service-to-service authentication.
- Reviewing existing auth code or debugging a login/logout problem.

## Ground rules

1. **Don't build crypto or an IdP from scratch.** Use a managed IdP or a maintained, widely used library for OAuth/OIDC, session handling, password hashing and token signing. Your code wires them together.
2. **Authentication says who; authorization says what.** Both happen on the server. Hiding a button is not authorization.
3. **Deny by default.** A route with no explicit policy should reject.
4. **Never put secrets where the browser can read them**: no client secrets in SPAs or mobile apps, no tokens in `localStorage`, no tokens in URLs.
5. **Follow current guidance**: the OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice (RFC 9700) and OpenID Connect Core. The OAuth 2.1 draft consolidates the same rules. When unsure about a detail, read the spec or the IdP's docs rather than guessing.

## Choose the flow

| Client | Recommended | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server-rendered web app | Authorization code + PKCE, confidential client | Store tokens server-side; browser gets a session cookie |
| Single-page app with a backend you control | **Backend-for-frontend (BFF)**: the backend runs the code flow and keeps tokens; browser gets an HttpOnly session cookie | Removes tokens from JavaScript entirely; preferred |
| Single-page app with no backend | Authorization code + PKCE as a public client | Keep access tokens in memory, short-lived; refresh token rotation or sender-constrained tokens |
| Native / mobile app | Authorization code + PKCE through the system browser (RFC 8252) | Never an embedded web view for login; no client secret in the app |
| CLI, TV, IoT with limited input | Device authorization grant (RFC 8628) | Poll politely; show the verification URL and code |
| Machine to machine | Client credentials, or workload identity / mTLS | No user involved; scope tokens narrowly |
| Your own username/password form, no IdP | Server-side sessions + a strong password hash | Consider an IdP anyway; you take on MFA, recovery, breach handling |

**Do not use** the implicit grant or the resource owner password credentials grant. RFC 9700 says clients SHOULD NOT use the implicit grant and the password grant MUST NOT be used; the OAuth 2.1 draft removes both.

## Authorization code flow checklist

- Use **PKCE with `S256`** for every client, including confidential ones.
- Send a random, single-use **`state`** and verify it on callback (CSRF protection for the login itself).
- For OIDC, send a **`nonce`** and verify it in the ID token.
- Register **exact redirect URIs**. No wildcards, no open redirects after login (validate any `returnTo` against an allowlist of paths).
- Exchange the code on the back channel; codes are single-use and short-lived.
- Request the minimum **scopes**.

## Validate tokens fully

**ID token** (proves the user signed in to your client):

- Verify the signature using keys from the IdP's JWKS (`jwks_uri` from the discovery document). Cache keys; refetch on unknown `kid`.
- Check `iss` equals the expected issuer, `aud` contains your client ID, `exp` is in the future (small clock skew allowance), and `nonce` matches.
- Use the ID token to establish your session. Don't send it to APIs as an access token.

**Access token** (presented to your API):

- If it's a JWT: verify signature, **allowlist the algorithm** (never accept `none`, never let the token choose between symmetric and asymmetric), check `iss`, `aud` equals **this API**, `exp`, and required scopes or roles.
- If it's opaque: use the IdP's introspection endpoint (RFC 7662) and cache results briefly.
- JWT payloads are only base64-encoded, not encrypted. Don't put sensitive data in them.

## Sessions vs tokens

| | Server-side session + cookie | Tokens held by the client |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revocation | Immediate (delete the session) | Hard until expiry; needs short lifetimes or introspection |
| XSS exposure | Cookie is HttpOnly, not readable by script | Tokens in JS memory can be used by injected script |
| CSRF exposure | Needs SameSite + CSRF tokens for state-changing requests | Not cookie-based, so no CSRF; bearer tokens are the risk |
| Best for | Browsers | APIs called by mobile apps, services, third parties |

Cookie settings for session cookies: `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax` (or `Strict` if cross-site navigation doesn't need to stay logged in), `Path=/`, and the `__Host-` name prefix when possible (it requires `Secure`, `Path=/` and no `Domain`). Regenerate the session ID at login and privilege change (prevents session fixation). Set idle and absolute timeouts.

## Token lifetimes, refresh and revocation

- Access tokens: short-lived (minutes, not days).
- Refresh tokens: **rotate on every use**; if an old refresh token is reused, revoke the whole token family (it was stolen). Bind refresh tokens to the client; for public clients use rotation or sender-constrained tokens (DPoP, RFC 9449; or mTLS-bound tokens, RFC 8705).
- Support revocation (RFC 7009) on logout and on password or MFA change.
- Store refresh tokens encrypted at rest on the server side.

## Logout

1. Destroy the local session (server-side) and clear the cookie.
2. Revoke refresh tokens you hold.
3. If the user should also leave the IdP session, redirect to the IdP's end-session endpoint (OIDC RP-initiated logout) with an allowlisted post-logout redirect.
4. For multiple apps sharing an IdP, consider OIDC back-channel logout so other apps end their sessions.

## Passwords, MFA and passkeys (if you own credentials)

- Hash with **Argon2id** (preferred), scrypt or bcrypt via a maintained library, with parameters from current OWASP guidance. PBKDF2 only where FIPS requires it.
- Follow NIST SP 800-63B: favor length over composition rules, check new passwords against breached-password lists, no forced periodic rotation.
- Rate-limit and add backoff on login, MFA and reset endpoints. Return the same response for "unknown user" and "wrong password".
- Password reset tokens: random, single-use, short expiry, stored hashed, invalidated on use and on password change.
- MFA: offer passkeys/WebAuthn (phishing-resistant) and TOTP. SMS is the weakest option. Require re-authentication for sensitive actions (changing email, password, MFA, payout details).

## Authorization

| Model | Use when | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RBAC (roles) | Permissions follow job function | `admin`, `editor`, `viewer` |
| ABAC (attributes) | Rules depend on attributes of user, resource, context | "Managers may approve expenses under their cost center below 5,000" |
| ReBAC (relationships) | Access follows ownership/sharing graphs | Docs shared with a user or group, nested folders (Zanzibar-style systems such as OpenFGA, SpiceDB) |

Rules:

- Check on **every request** and at the **object level**: "may this user perform this action on this record?", not just "is this user logged in?". Missing object checks cause IDOR, the most common auth bug.
- Derive user and tenant from the authenticated session or token, never from request parameters.
- Centralize policy in one module or a policy engine (for example OPA or Cedar) instead of scattered `if` checks.
- Filter list endpoints by permission in the query, not after fetching.
- Write tests for denial: wrong user, wrong tenant, wrong role, expired token, no token.

## Service-to-service

- Prefer **workload identity** (cloud-managed identities, Kubernetes service account federation, SPIFFE) over long-lived shared secrets.
- Otherwise use the client credentials grant with narrowly scoped tokens, or mTLS.
- Each service validates incoming tokens itself; don't trust "it came from inside the network".
- When acting on behalf of a user, propagate the user's identity (token exchange, RFC 8693) instead of using a god-mode service account.

## Common bugs

| Bug | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| JWT signature not verified, or `alg: none` accepted | Use a library; pin allowed algorithms; verify before reading claims |
| `aud` not checked, so tokens for another API are accepted | Check `aud` equals this API |
| Authorization only in the frontend | Enforce on the server for every endpoint |
| IDOR: `/orders/123` returns any user's order | Scope queries by the session's user/tenant |
| Tokens in `localStorage` | BFF with HttpOnly cookie, or in-memory tokens |
| Missing `state` or exact redirect URI matching | Add `state`; register exact URIs |
| Open redirect after login | Allowlist `returnTo` paths |
| Session ID not rotated at login | Regenerate on login and privilege change |
| Long-lived access tokens with no revocation | Short lifetimes + refresh rotation |
| User enumeration via login or reset messages | Uniform responses and timing |
| Secrets for confidential clients committed or shipped in apps | Secret manager; public clients use PKCE without secrets |

## Safety

- Never paste real user credentials, tokens or client secrets into code, logs, tests or chat. Use test tenants and test users.
- Changing IdP configuration, rotating production signing keys or revoking sessions in production affects real users: describe the change and get explicit confirmation first.

## Done when

- The flow matches the table for the client type, with PKCE, `state`, `nonce` and exact redirect URIs.
- Every token is validated (signature, algorithm, `iss`, `aud`, `exp`, scopes) before use.
- No tokens or secrets are readable by browser JavaScript unless the no-backend SPA case was chosen deliberately.
- Every endpoint has a server-side authorization check at object level, with denial tests.
- Logout destroys the session and revokes refresh tokens.
