description: Makes web pages crawlable, indexable and shareable by choosing the right rendering mode (CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR, streaming) and getting metadata, canonicals, structured data, sitemaps, status codes, hreflang and hydration right. Use when building public pages, choosing between client and server rendering, fixing pages missing from search or showing bad link previews, adding meta tags, JSON-LD, sitemap.xml or robots.txt, or debugging hydration mismatch errors.

# SEO and Server-Side Rendering

A crawler should get the page's real content, links and metadata in the first HTML response, with the correct status code. Everything else is refinement. Search engines publish what they support; don't invent ranking factors or promise rankings.

## When to use

- Building or reviewing public, indexable pages (marketing, docs, product, blog, listings).
- Choosing a rendering mode for a new route or framework.
- Pages missing from search results, duplicate pages indexed, or wrong snippets.
- Link previews (social, chat apps) showing no image or the wrong title.
- Hydration mismatch warnings or errors.

Not for: performance work on LCP, INP and CLS (see the **web-performance** skill). Internationalized content itself is covered by **internationalization**; this skill covers `hreflang`.

## Workflow

1. **See what the crawler sees.** Fetch the server HTML without running JavaScript:
   `curl -sL https://example.com/page | grep -iE "<title>|rel=\"canonical\"|og:|name=\"robots\""`
   If the main content, title or links are missing, rendering is the first problem to fix.
2. **Pick the rendering mode** per route using the table below.
3. **Set metadata** per page: title, description, canonical, robots, Open Graph. Read [references/head-and-files.md](references/head-and-files.md) for copy-ready tags, JSON-LD, sitemap and robots.txt examples.
4. **Fix links and URLs**: real `<a href>` links, one canonical URL per page, redirects for the rest.
5. **Return correct status codes** from the server, including for unknown routes in single-page apps.
6. **Add structured data** that matches the visible content.
7. **Fix hydration mismatches** (table below).
8. **Verify** with the tools under "Done when".
9. Changes to `robots.txt`, site-wide `noindex`, canonicals or mass redirects affect how a whole site is indexed. Show the user the change and get confirmation before deploying it.

## Rendering mode

| Mode | Server HTML has content? | Good for | Watch out for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CSR (client-only) | No, only a shell | Logged-in apps, dashboards, anything not meant to be indexed | Crawlers that don't run JS see nothing; social previews break |
| SSR (per request) | Yes | Personalized or fast-changing public pages, search results pages | Server cost and TTFB; don't cache personalized HTML in shared caches |
| SSG (build time) | Yes | Docs, blogs, marketing pages | Rebuilds needed to update content |
| ISR / static regeneration | Yes | Large catalogs that change sometimes | Stale pages until regeneration; know your framework's revalidation rules |
| Streaming SSR | Yes, in chunks | Pages with slow data sections | Put title, meta tags and main content in the early part, not in late-streamed parts |

Default for public content: SSG or ISR when content changes less often than it is read, otherwise SSR. Use CSR only for pages that don't need to be indexed or previewed.

Google renders JavaScript, but rendering can be deferred, and many other crawlers and link-preview bots don't run JavaScript at all. Metadata and Open Graph tags must be in the server HTML.

## Metadata essentials

| Tag | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `<title>` | Unique per page, describes the page; brand at the end |
| `<meta name="description">` | Unique summary; search engines may use it for the snippet |
| `<link rel="canonical">` | Absolute URL of the preferred version; self-referencing on the canonical page |
| `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` | For pages that must not be indexed (search results pages, thank-you pages, staging) |
| Open Graph (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`, `og:type`) | `og:image` must be an absolute URL; check the size each platform recommends |
| `<html lang="...">` | Set the page's language |

## Links and URLs

- Use real `<a href="/path">` links. Crawlers don't click `<div onClick>` or buttons.
- Use history-API routing, not hash routing (`/#/products`): fragments are not separate URLs to crawlers.
- Pick one URL form (https, with or without `www`, trailing slash or not) and 301/308-redirect the others.
- Strip tracking and session parameters from canonicals.
- For infinite scroll or "load more", also provide paginated URLs (`?page=2`) reachable by normal links.

## Status codes

| Situation | Return |
| --- | --- |
| Page moved permanently | 301 or 308 to the new URL (one hop, no chains) |
| Temporary move | 302 or 307 |
| Page doesn't exist | 404 (or 410 if gone for good) |
| Server error | 5xx, never a 200 error page |

A **soft 404** is a "not found" page served with status 200. In single-page apps, make the server or edge return 404 for unknown routes. If that is impossible, add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` on the not-found view.

## robots.txt vs noindex

- `robots.txt` `Disallow` stops **crawling**, not indexing. A blocked URL can still appear in results if other sites link to it.
- To keep a page out of the index, allow crawling and serve `noindex` (meta tag or `X-Robots-Tag` header). A crawler blocked by robots.txt never sees the `noindex`.
- Protect staging sites with authentication, not just `noindex` or robots.txt.

## Structured data

- Use JSON-LD (`<script type="application/ld+json">`) with schema.org types such as `Article`, `Product`, `BreadcrumbList` and `Organization`.
- It must describe content that is visible on the page. Markup for invisible content is against search engine guidelines.
- Which types produce rich results changes over time. Check the search engine's current structured data docs before promising a rich result.

## Multilingual sites (hreflang)

- Each language version lists all versions, including itself, with `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="xx" href="...">`, using absolute URLs.
- Links must be reciprocal: if page A points to B, B must point back to A.
- Add `hreflang="x-default"` for the fallback or language picker page.
- Don't auto-redirect by IP or `Accept-Language` without a way to reach other versions; crawlers may only see one.

## Hydration mismatches

The server HTML and the first client render must match.

| Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Dates, times, time zones, locale formatting | Render with a fixed time zone and locale on both sides, or format on the client after mount |
| `Math.random()`, generated IDs | Use the framework's stable ID helper (for example `useId` in React) |
| `typeof window !== 'undefined'` branches in render | Render the same markup first; switch in an effect or a client-only component |
| Invalid HTML nesting (`<div>` inside `<p>`, nested `<a>`) | Fix the markup; the browser rewrites invalid HTML before hydration |
| User-specific data in cached HTML | Don't cache personalized HTML in shared caches; load per-user data on the client |
| Browser extensions changing the DOM | Usually harmless; confirm in a clean browser profile before chasing it |

Suppression flags (such as React's `suppressHydrationWarning`) are for single unavoidable values like timestamps, not whole components.

## Anti-patterns

- **Launching with staging settings**: site-wide `noindex` or `Disallow: /` copied to production.
- **Content only after a client fetch** on pages meant to rank.
- **Canonical pointing to page 1 from every paginated page**, which hides pages 2+ from the index.
- **Meta tags added by client JavaScript only**, so link previews are empty.
- **Redirect chains and loops** after URL migrations.
- **Hiding text or links for crawlers** (cloaking): serve crawlers what users see.

## Done when

- Server HTML (`curl`, no JS) contains the title, description, canonical, Open Graph tags, main content and navigation links.
- Unknown URLs return 404; moved URLs return a single 301/308.
- No accidental `noindex` or `Disallow` on pages meant to be indexed.
- Structured data passes the Rich Results Test or the Schema Markup Validator.
- Search Console URL Inspection (live test) shows the rendered page with its content.
- Lighthouse SEO audit has no failing checks you haven't consciously accepted.
- No hydration mismatch warnings in the browser console.
